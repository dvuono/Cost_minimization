# Cost_minimization

This repository contains a collection of scripts used in microbial cost minimization calculations for the preprint manuscript available on bioRxiv: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/03/364331. Available are calculations for atoms per residue side-chain for Carbon (C), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O). Directions for usage are commented in the scripts.

Also available are some fun jupyter notebooks that make bokeh plots that show the relationship between amino acid molecular weight and their AT codon usage.
